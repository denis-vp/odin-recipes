      The best tacos! A soft shell taco is layered with refried beans, then
      wrapped around a hard shell taco, which is filled with seasoned ground
      beef and topped with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, sour cream and fresh
      guacamole. You can top it with whatever you like, but I recommend loading
      it up! Also, if you don't eat meat, put melted cheese on the soft shell,
      and the refried beans in the hard.

      <li>1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix, divided</li>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) can refried beans</li>
      <li>⅔ cup water</li>
      <li>2 prepared crisp taco shells</li>
      <li>2 avocados</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon sour cream</li>
      <li>1 fresh lime, juiced</li>
      <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>12 (7 inch) flour tortillas</li>
      <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded lettuce</li>
      <li>1 large tomato, chopped</li>
      <li>¼ red onion, chopped</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h4>Step 1:</h4>
        <p>
          Place the ground beef in a skillet over medium heat, and sprinkle
          about 3/4 of the packet of taco seasoning over the meat. Cook and stir
          the ground beef, breaking it up as it cooks, until the beef is browned
          and crumbly, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain the excess grease.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Step 2:</h4>
        <p>
          Mash the refried beans with the water in a small saucepan, and
          sprinkle with the rest of the seasoning packet. Heat the refried beans
          over low heat until simmering.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Step 3:</h4>
        <p>
          Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Place the crisp taco
          shells on a baking sheet, and warm them in the preheated oven for 3 to
          5 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Step 4:</h4>
        <p>
          To make the guacamole, peel, seed, and mash the avocados in a bowl
          with 1 tablespoon of sour cream, the lime juice, and salt and pepper
          to taste, and set aside.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Step 5:</h4>
        <p>
          To build the tacos, spread each flour tortilla with about 2
          tablespoons of heated refried beans. Wrap the tortilla gently around a
          crisp tortilla shell. Spread about 2 tablespoons of ground beef along
          the bottom of the crisp shell, and sprinkle about 2 tablespoons of
          shredded Cheddar cheese on top of the meat. Top the cheese with
          shredded lettuce, a sprinkle of chopped tomato and onion, and a dollop
          of sour cream and guacamole.
